# search-solution
This application is written first in nodejs using Express framework, and ejs. It has a frontend rendered form using ejs. The server runs on port 3000, 
testing can be done by installing nodejs from website below
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
deployment and testing steps
clone the code from the repo and cd to the directory 
run the command - inside where the files index.js is in the project
node index.js
this will render the homep age with an input and a button to submit yur search functionality.

Secondly the Appliocation has a C# code which I'm working on as it's not my native language so I 
decided to have it written in a language as nodejs before translating it to C#
